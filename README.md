# DiabetesLogbook
Repository for my Diabetes Logbook project.

This project was created to help track my calories, carbohydrates, and blood sugar levels. It uses HTML/CSS to display the logbook in a neat and readable way and PHP to access the MySQL database.

The database contains tables to store the logbook entries, as well as tables for common meals and snacks I eat so the calories and carbs fields can be auto-populated.

The Previous Logs tab is a link to view past entries. It shows then logbook from the day before by default.

The Add Food tab is a link to add a meal or snack to the database.
